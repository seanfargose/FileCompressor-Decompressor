This project is about Building an application for Text File Compression using Huffman Coding. Given a a text file as an input, 
this app will compress the file and then save the file with reduced size. You can also decompress the file using this app into 
its original form. This app also has some additional features such as: Given a string of alphabetic characters, you can compress 
the size of its bit sequence to obtain a binary sequence that has size significantly lesser than the original, this new sequence 
then can be sent through a network or saved in file so that it can be decompressed whenever required.
